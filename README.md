# Typescript Server Boilerplate

## Getting started

There are three main npm scripts:

`npm run dev`: starts the web server using `nodemon` and `./src/server.ts` as the entrypoint.
`npm run build`: compiles all `.ts` files in the `./src` directory, placing them in `./dist`
`npm run start`: starts the web server using `node` and `./dist/server.js` as the entrypoint.
